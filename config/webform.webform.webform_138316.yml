Inclusive by nature, he sought to bring people together in common purpose and to be as big and as powerful as they could in search of social justice. He learned Arabic and studied the Middle East, hoping that he would employ his skills to reduce conflict in that corner of the world.</p><p>An endowed fund was established in Zander’s name to ensure that generations of USF students are able to follow Zander’s path to public service. The fund is designed to support student participation in the McCarthy Fellows in Sacramento, USF in DC, Privett Global Scholars, or other community engaged learning programs as well as those young leaders beginning their careers in public service.
