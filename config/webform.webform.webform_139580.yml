All new first-year students are invited to take a 1-unit course called USF101, or “Expedition USF,” during their first semester on campus. Students enrolled in USF101 meet weekly, engaging with an instructor, a peer mentor, and each other to explore their new environment and chart their four-year college journey.</p><p>This year, USF101 is offering two sections that will be linked to your housing assignment. This unique housing option will provide first-year students an opportunity to connect and learn, both in and out of the classroom, alongside fellow students, staff, and faculty--all while enjoying the conveniences of living on campus within the residence halls. If you are interested, please complete the form. Please note: If selected, you will be pre-enrolled in the USF101 section on Tuesdays 6:00pm section during the Fall 2018. <strong>Note that there is a small window to register, as Round 1 of housing notifications is June 1 and the deadline to register is June 3rd at 11:59pm.</strong></p><p>More information about USF101 please go to:</p><p><a href='https://myusf.usfca.edu/student-life/usf101' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer nofollow'>https://myusf.usfca.edu/student-life/usf101</a></p>\"\n  '#title': Instructions\n  '#description': \"\"\nfirst_name:\n  '#type': textfield\n  '#title': First Name\n  '#description': \"\"\n  '#required': true\nlast_name:\n  '#type': textfield\n  '#title': Last Name\n  '#description': \"\"\n  '#required': true\ndons_email_address:\n  '#type': textfield\n  '#field_suffix': (Dons alias and add \"@dons.usfca.edu\")\n  '#title': Dons email address\n  '#description': \"\"\n  '#required': true\npersonal_email_address:\n  '#type': textfield\n  '#title': Personal email address\n  '#description': \"\"\nplease_select_one_of_the_options:\n  '#type': radios\n  '#options':\n    1: I have received my housing assignment and it is in Hayes-Healy Hall\n    2: I have not received my housing assignment yet\n    3: Other: Write in response\n  '#title': Please select one of the options\n  '#description': \"\"\n  '#required': true\nif_other:\n  '#type': textarea\n  '#title': If Other:\n  '#description': \"\"\n  '#states':\n    visible:\n      ':input[name=\"please_select_one_of_the_options[3]\"]':\n        checked: true\n"
