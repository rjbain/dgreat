McCarthy Center for Public Service and the Common Good</strong></h2>\\n\\n<h3><strong>Alexander (Zander) Urban Fund</strong></h3>\\n\\n<p>Alexander Urban was a Seattle native and exemplary student at USF who graduated from USF in May of 2011. A dynamic and engaging student, he served in the California State Capitol as a McCarthy Fellow in the Governor&rsquo;s Office of Economic Development and later accepted a part-time position on Governor Schwarzenegger staff while maintaining his academic schedule and life in San Francisco. In the week following his graduation, Zander was struck crossing a San Francisco street and passed away the following day.</p>\\n\\n<p>Zander aspired to a career of public service and inspired others with his wit, intelligence, joy for public service, and commitment to justice. Inclusive by nature, he sought to bring people together in common purpose and to be as big and as powerful as they could in search of social justice. He learned Arabic and studied the Middle East, hoping that he would employ his skills to reduce conflict in that corner of the world.</p>\\n\\n<p>An endowed fund was established in Zander&rsquo;s name to ensure that generations of USF students are able to follow Zander&rsquo;s path to public service. The fund is designed to support student participation in the McCarthy Fellows in Sacramento, USF in DC, Privett Global Scholars, or other community engaged learning programs as well as those young leaders beginning their careers in public service. Awards are made from this discretionary fund by the Director of McCarthy Center.</p>\\n\\n<h3><strong>Applicant Eligibility</strong></h3>\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Applicant is enrolled as a full-time undergraduate student at the University of San Francisco.</li>\\n\\t<li>Applicant has been accepted into the <strong>McCarthy Fellows, USF in DC, Privett Global Scholars,</strong> or<strong> other community engaged learning programs</strong>.</li>\\n\\t<li>Applicant is in academic good standing.</li>\\n\\t<li>Applicant submits an essay and a resume with his or her application.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h3><strong>Alexander (Zander) Urban Fund</strong></h3>\\n\\n<h4>Application</h4>\\n\\n<p>The Alexander (Zander) Urban Fund awards scholarships to students participating in the McCarthy Center&rsquo;s McCarthy Fellows, USF in DC, Privett Global Scholars, or other community engaged learning programs. The award of up to $2,500 is in memory of Alexander (Zander) Urban, class of 2011, an alumnus of the McCarthy Fellows program and exemplar of the McCarthy Center&rsquo;s values. The scholarship is meant to provide financial assistance to cover costs associated with participation in McCarthy Center programs, beyond tuition, including lodging, travel, and meals.</p>\"\nname:\n  '#type': textfield\n  '#title': Name\n  '#required': true\nemail:\n  '#type': email\n  '#title': Email\n  '#required': true\nyear:\n  '#type': textfield\n  '#title': Year\n  '#required': true\nmajor:\n  '#type': textfield\n  '#title': Major\n  '#required': true\ngpa:\n  '#type': textfield\n  '#title': GPA\n  '#required': true\nplease_explain_why_you_are_seeking_the_urban_scholarship_and_how:\n  '#type': textarea\n  '#title': 'Please explain why you are seeking the Urban scholarship and how you will use the funds.
