## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start Lando

lando start

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the theme directory:

cd web/themes/custom/myusf
lando npm install

This will install the Node dependencies listed in `package.json`. Make sure `package-lock.json` is committed to maintain consistency.

### 3. Build Assets

lando gulp

Gulp will:

* Compile SCSS into CSS
* Minify and bundle JS
* Optimize image assets

## 💡 Notes for Developers

* **Node version**: Node 18 is used via Lando.
* **Gulp CLI** is available via `lando gulp`. No global install needed.
* **Lock files**: Always commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json` when changing dependencies.
* **CircleCI** builds and compiles theme assets automatically on commit.

## 🧪 CI/CD

CircleCI is configured to:

* Run PHP linting and unit tests
* Build theme assets using Gulp
* Deploy to Pantheon

To trigger the pipeline, push changes to GitHub.
