# modify to suit.  It will then be loaded by settings.pantheon.php
# on any dev or multidev environment (not on 'test' or 'live').

# If you would like to define any services or service parameters
# that apply only to production environments ('test' and 'live'),
# you may do so in a 'services.pantheon.production.yml' file.

# See 'default.services.yml' for information on useful settings to
