Feature: Cas Authentication
  As a MyUSF user
  I am able to authenticate using CAS
  So that I may use my university credentials to login

#  @api
#  Scenario: Faculty
#    Given I am an anonymous user
#    And I am on "/caslogin"
#    And I fill in "username" with "dfaculty"
#    And I fill in "password" with "StashBoard1"
#    Then I should be on the homepage
#    And I should see the message "You have logged in"
#    And I am logged in as a user with the "faculty" role
